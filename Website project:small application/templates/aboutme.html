                <p><span class="font-semibold">Academic Skills:</span> I'm good at math, that's what I've been told. But I don't like math class. But I am interested in biology, I guess I'm pretty good and knowledgeable in that area? I'm also ok at abacus, python coding and social studies? I can speak English, Chinese, Japanese, and a little Spanish. I can read and write in English, a little in Chinese and Japanese.</p>
                <p><span class="font-semibold">Life Skills:</span> I can cook rice and use the microwave. I burnt a fork while boiling water for cup noodles, so I guess I can't boil water properly. I can sew and I know multiple embroidering patterns. I know how to fix stuff with duct tape, I guess.</p>
                <p><span class="font-semibold">Extracuricular Skills:</span> I play volleyball, basketball, and I act. I also rescued stray cats, since there are a lot in Japan. I also draw, paint, and make stuff with cardboard.</p>
