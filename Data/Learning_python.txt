I learned about lists, dictionary, classes, functions, and loops 
It was fun because I can tell andy that I know what he knows and I am about to beat him in python
I also liked the way Mr. Umair teached me because it is easy to understand and I am able to build confidence and also learn new things everyday!
And I like cheese 
and cats
