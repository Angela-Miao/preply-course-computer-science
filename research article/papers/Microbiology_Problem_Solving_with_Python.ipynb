    "In this exercise, we will analyze the growth rate of bacteria under different temperature conditions to determine the optimal temperature for the growth of a specific bacterial species.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "- Temperature conditions: 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°C.\n",
    "- Optical density readings taken at regular intervals (e.g., every hour for 24 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Collection\n",
    "```python\n",
